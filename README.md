# Android Portfolio App
Portfolio is an Android app which consumes REST APIs I developed using Springboot to showcase my resume. It also grants users, be it recruiters or otherwise the ability to communicate with me using the inbuilt chat function which uses Firebase.
Beyond just being an app people can use to view my resume and chat with me, it also acts as a gateway for those who want to learn more about more technical ability. It is meant to demonstrate, at a small scale, my ability to develop, work on and manage an Android project.

Please feel free to fork the project and check it out. I would love some feedback either via email or via the chat function in the app.
